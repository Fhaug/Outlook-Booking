SB Parking, an application developed for booking Statsbyggs parkingspace.


Developed during the summer internship at Statsbygg in 2017.
The app uses Microsoft GRAPH-API to connect and push events to the calendar. 
	The version of Microsoft GRAPH is V1.0. 

The application uses Cocoapods to verify the user data and as a dependency for JSON.
To deploy this code, download and run in XCode. You might have to change the signer in the general options.
